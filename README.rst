TSTN-058
========

The MTAOS control loop is complex and has many parameters.  In addition, because the measured Zernikes are noisy, and because of night-night variation, it is difficult to make definitive tests on sky.  This technote describes a simulation package that allows testing alternate control loop schemes using on sky data from which the calculated correctioons have been removed, giving an effective stream of open-loop Zernike measurements.
